# Predicting Particulate Matter Concentrations in Indian Cities Using Hourly Data with AWS Cloud Services

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on predicting particulate matter concentrations in Indian cities using hourly data obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) website. The project showcases the potential of machine learning models in accurately predicting particulate matter concentrations and contributes by making the dataset available on Kaggle.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains air quality data for Indian cities spanning from the year 2010 to 2023. It provides detailed information about the air quality conditions in 453 cities across India. The data has been collected from the Central Control Room for Air Quality Management, indicating that it is a reliable and authoritative source.
